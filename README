Pygment style is zenburn.py

On my mac the path to the directory to place zenburn.py is /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pygments/styles

I hacked the following line so my pygments would load.  In upstream versions of iPython this is not necessary.

grep -n -r zenburn .
./site-packages/IPython/frontend/qt/console/styles.py:44:default_dark_syntax_style = 'zenburn'
Use grep -n -r linux . to find the line for yourself.

Starting ipython

ipython-2.7 qtconsole --editor=vim --colors=linux --stylesheet=zenburn_ipython.css 

#TODO change traceback highlighting
